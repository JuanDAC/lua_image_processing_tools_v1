# Pixel Art Suite for Aseprite

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive suite of tools and extensions for Aseprite, a popular pixel art editor. Leveraging advanced knowledge in mathematics, design, color theory, color representation models, image filters, and matrices, this suite extends Aseprite's capabilities beyond its existing plugins and tools.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **color**: Contains modules related to color management, including filters, harmonies, and transformations.
- **image_processing**: Includes modules for image processing, pixel handling, and transformations.
- **interfaces**: Provides definitions for interfaces used throughout the suite.
- **internal**: Contains internal classes and system modules.
- **languages**: Supports multiple languages with localization files.
- **lifecycle**: Manages the lifecycle of the application, including initialization and main logic.
